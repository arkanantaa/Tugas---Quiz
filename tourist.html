        <h1> Kraton Kasunanan Surakarta</h1>
        <p> Kraton Kasunanan Surakarta is like stepping into a piece of living history. It's the royal palace where Javanese culture and traditions are still very much alive. 
            You can wander around the beautiful architecture, soak in the serenity of the palace grounds, and get a sense of how the royal family used to live. The museum inside is full of cool artifacts, from ancient weapons to royal regalia, giving you a glimpse into the rich history of the Javanese monarchy.
            Plus, the traditional ceremonies that still take place here are a must-see if you're lucky to catch one!
        </p>

        <h1> Pura Mangkunegaran </h1>
        <p>
            Pura Mangkunegaran feels like a hidden gem in the heart of Solo. It's smaller than the Kraton, but don't let that fool you—it's just as majestic.
            This beautiful palace is a blend of Javanese and European styles, which makes the architecture so unique.
            You can take a guided tour to learn about the royal family who still lives here or just stroll around the peaceful gardens. 
            It's a quiet, serene place where you can really take a break from the bustling city and feel the old-world charm of Solo.
        </p>

        <h1> Solo Safari </h1>
        <p> 
            Solo Safari is perfect if you want to mix nature with a bit of fun. It’s a family-friendly spot where you can get up close with animals like elephants, tigers, and playful primates. 
            The cool part? They really focus on conservation here, so it feels good to know you’re supporting a place that cares about the animals.
            You can also take a safari ride to see the wildlife in a more natural setting, which is a great way to spend a relaxed day outdoors without going too far from the city center.
        </p>

        <h1> Sangiran Museum </h1>
        <p> 
            Sangiran Museum is a bit of a time machine. It's one of the most important prehistoric sites in the world, and the museum here is packed with fossils, including early human remains that go back millions of years.
            The exhibits are really well done, giving you a peek into what life was like way, way back.
            Even if you're not a history buff, it's hard not to be fascinated by the ancient discoveries that put this little spot in Solo on the map for archaeologists around the globe.
