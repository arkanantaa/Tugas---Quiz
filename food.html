        <h1> Gudeg Solo </h1>
        <img src="images/gudeg-solo.jpg" alt="Gudeng Solo">
        <p> Gudeg Solo is a traditional Javanese dish originating from the city of Solo, Central Java. 
            It is a savory and slightly sweet stew made primarily from young jackfruit, slow-cooked in coconut milk and a blend of aromatic spices such as coriander, garlic, and palm sugar. 
            Unlike the Yogyakarta version, Gudeg Solo tends to be less sweet and includes more coconut milk, giving it a creamier and richer texture. Often served with rice, 
            Gudeg Solo is accompanied by various side dishes such as opor ayam (chicken in coconut milk), tempeh, tofu, and hard-boiled eggs, 
            making it a hearty and satisfying meal that reflects the rich culinary heritage of Central Java.
